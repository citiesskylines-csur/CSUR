# Cairo Dependency
Creation of the thumbnail icons in CSUR roads uses the PyCairo Python package. As PyCairo is an open-source software, its Python 3.7 / Windows build is provided here for easier integration into a Blender script. If you use another operating system, you need to replace the contents in this folder with the correct PyCairo build for your OS.
